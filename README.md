# Soil Spectroscopy Data Analysis

This project focuses on developing algorithms to interpret complex spectroscopic soil data. The project includes tools for data preprocessing, spectral analysis, and machine learning model development.

## Project Structure

- `soil_spectroscopy_analysis.py`: Main script for data analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies
- `soildataset.xlsx`: Input data file

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main analysis script:
```bash
python soil_spectroscopy_analysis.py
```

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Spectral analysis and visualization
- Machine learning model development
- Performance evaluation

## Data Format

The input data should be in Excel format (.xlsx) with the following structure:
- Spectral measurements as columns
- Soil properties as target variables
- Each row represents a soil sample

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- openpyxl
